# Maintenance Checklist

To ensure the `sec-guidebook` repository remains a trusted and professional resource, maintainers should perform the following checks.

## Monthly Checks
- [ ] **Link Rot**: Verify all external links are active. Replace dead links with archived versions (Archive.org) if necessary.
- [ ] **Content Validity**: Review "Recent Attacks" sections. If an attack is debunked or details change significantly, update the entry.

## Updating the Guide
- [ ] **Source Policy**: **STRICT.** Only add incidents backed by a *direct link* to a reputable news outlet (e.g., Le Parisien, BBC, NYT, The Guardian).
    - ❌ NO generic homepages (e.g., `https://cnn.com`)
    - ❌ NO social media threads as sole sources (unless from official verified authorities).
- [ ] **Formatting**: Keep the Markdown clean.
    - Use `-` or `1.` consistently (Standard is numbered lists for sequences).
    - Ensure dates are formatted as `**Mon Year (Location) - Title:**`.
- [ ] **Tone**: maintain a neutral, technical, and objective tone. Avoid sensationalism or marketing fluff.

## Annual Review
- [ ] **Archive**: Move incidents older than 2 years to a separate `ARCHIVE.md` or a "Historical" section if the main README becomes too long.
- [ ] **Tech Review**: Update software wallet recommendations (deprecated tools, new standards).
